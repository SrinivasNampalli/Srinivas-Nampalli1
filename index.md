  As an avid follower of the Ferrari F1 racing team, a dedicated Java coder, and an aspiring machine learning enthusiast, my world revolves around the synergy of high-speed racing and intricate technology. Just as the Ferrari team fine-tunes their cars, I meticulously craft Java code to achieve optimal performance. The thrill of seeing a program run smoothly mirrors the excitement of a perfectly executed pit stop. Exploring machine learning mirrors F1's data-driven strategies, where insights are gleaned from complex information. Just as F1 fans unite, I'm part of a global community of Java aficionados and aspiring data scientists. The shared passion for speed, precision, and innovation drives me to constantly learn, improve, and be part of these dynamic realms.

## Overview of Hacks, Study and Tangibles
Blogging in GitHub pages is a way to learn and code at the same time. 

- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder.
